- Use p to print a value in it's real form; p v is equivalent to print v.inspect.
- Use eval() to translate a string to ruby code, useful when reading objects from a text file.
    like:
hash_str = File.read('my_file.txt')
my_hash  = eval(hash_str) # Treat a string like Ruby code and evaluate it

# or, as a one-liner
my_hash  = eval(File.read('my_file.txt'))
